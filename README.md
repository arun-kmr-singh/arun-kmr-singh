# Hello, folks! <img src="https://github.com/arun-kmr-singh/arun-kmr-singh.github.io/blob/master/assets/Coolstuff/wave.gif" width="30px">
:octocat:
My name is Arun Kumar Singh and I'm an M.tech CSE Grad at Indian Institute of Technology Jammu with a major in Computer Science and Engineering and specialization in Information Security. I am currently an SDE Intern at Amazon and an Ex Research Intern at IIT Bombay and currently working on Deep Learning and Machine Learning Applications in Audio and Forensics as a part of Research Interest. Feel free to connect with me for Projects and New Ideas, on [![Twitter](http://i.imgur.com/wWzX9uB.png)](https://twitter.com/arun_kmr_singh), or on [![LinkedIn](https://github.com/arun-kmr-singh/arun-kmr-singh.github.io/blob/master/assets/Coolstuff/linkedin-3-16.png)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arun-kmr-singh/). I am always up for Discussions on New Interesting Ideas and Work. 

When it comes to coding, I love to work on problem-solving questions and take part in various coding challenges. Apart from that in my free time, I play few sports: Badminton, Football and Swimming, but really enjoy participating in Adventure Sports. I love binge-watching TV series and chilling on my weekend nights and holidays.

Apart from Programming, Research and Development Stuff, I also sometimes write blogs :wink: - you can find my articles on [**Medium** ](https://medium.com/@singh.kmr.arun).
